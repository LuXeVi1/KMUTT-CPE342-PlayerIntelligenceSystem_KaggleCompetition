# Player Intelligence System - Project Overview

## 1. Introduction
The **Player Intelligence System** is a comprehensive Machine Learning framework designed to address the multifaceted challenges of modern online gaming. In an industry where user experience, fair play, and monetization are paramount, traditional rule-based systems often fail to adapt to the complexity of player behavior. This project leverages advanced data science techniques to create a holistic solution that enhances game integrity, optimizes revenue, and secures user assets.

## 2. Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project (Course: CPE342-ML) is to demonstrate the practical application of Machine Learning across five critical domains of game operations:
1.  **Fair Play (Anti-Cheat):** Detecting malicious actors who undermine competitive integrity.
2.  **Personalization (Segmentation):** Understanding player archetypes to tailor experiences.
3.  **Business Intelligence (Monetization):** Forecasting revenue to stabilize game economy.
4.  **Content Management (Computer Vision):** Automating the classification of visual assets.
5.  **Cybersecurity (Anomaly Detection):** Protecting player accounts from compromise.

## 3. System Architecture Overview
The system is built as a modular pipeline, where each task represents a specialized "Intelligence Module":
*   **Module 1: Cheater Detection Engine** (Supervised Classification)
*   **Module 2: Player Segmentation Engine** (Unsupervised/Supervised Hybrid)
*   **Module 3: Spending Forecast Engine** (Regression/Hurdle Models)
*   **Module 4: Game Vision Engine** (Deep Learning/Transformers)
*   **Module 5: Account Sentinel Engine** (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection)

By integrating these modules, the Player Intelligence System transforms raw log data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making for game developers and publishers.
